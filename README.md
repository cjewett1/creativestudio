# Creative Studio

This was a site that I was tasked with creating for my Web Design Fundamentals course in the DMIT Web Development and Design program at [NAIT.](https://www.nait.ca/programs/dmit-web-design-development?term=2023-winter)

I enjoyed making it because of the all the various elements and features present on the site.

### These include:
- Horizontal scroll on the mobile view
- Multiple parallax images
- Hamburger toggle navigation
- Absolutely positioned elements throughout
- Contact form with validation
- A responsive mobile-first design philosophy

Its a great looking website that and I am happy with how it turned out. I really had a lot of fun with this one, this site made me fall in love with web design.

While the site is not technically live, it is featured on my personal website under the Projects section.
